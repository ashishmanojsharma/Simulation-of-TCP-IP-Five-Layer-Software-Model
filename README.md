# Simulation-of-TCP-IP-Five-Layer-Software-Model
<h1>What is TCP/IP Model ?</h1>
<p>The OSI Model we just looked at is just a reference/logical model. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. But when we talk about the TCP/IP model, it was designed and developed by Department of Defense (DoD) in 1960s and is based on standard protocols. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains five layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model.</p>
<h2>The Five Layers are:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Process/Application Layer</li>
  <li>Host-to-Host/Transport Layer</li>
  <li>Internet/Network Layer</li>
  <li>Network Access/Link Layer</li>
  <li>Physical Layer</li>
</ol>
